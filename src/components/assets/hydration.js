            <p>Proper hydration is essential for shine and softness in your hair. It is the basis of the capillary schedule, 
                and it does not act deeply on the hair, but it is indispensable for the beauty and health of hair.</p>

            <p>The word hydration refers to water, doesnâ€™t it? And that is exactly the function of this step. Its job is to 
                replenish the moisture and hair nutrients to the hair, lost by the hair daily, due to external actions such 
                as wind, sun, pollution, and heat tools like the dryer.</p>

            <p>The capillary cortex, the innermost part of the hair shafts, is the beneficiary of it. This is because natural
                water guarantees the flexibility against breakage and the pleasant sensation of softness that we feel when we
                touch the hair.</p>

            <p>Vegetable glycerin is a natural moisturizer and conditioning agent. It has no chemical alteration, so it is capable
                of obtaining better results when it comes to water retention and absorption.</p>

            It is recommended to hydrate at least once a week.
