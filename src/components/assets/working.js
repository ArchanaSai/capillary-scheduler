        <p>Our hair needs certain nutrients to stay healthy. In the capillary schedule, these nutrients are 
        divided into three stages: Hydration, nutrition, and reconstruction. These steps are divided over 
        a period of one month, and the amount of each one will depend on the need for each hair.</p>

        <p>As you will use the 3 forms of treatment, it is possible to treat all hair problems. This schedule
        replaces the natural nutrients in the hair that, due to the chemicals used, are lost over time.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t have much effect on nourishing your hair if it doesn’t have enough water to absorb the 
        nutrition. There is also no point in rebuilding the hair if it is not nourished or hydrated enough 
        to maintain malleability. The reconstruction will harden the hair and cause it to break. 
        For this reason, sometimes we buy a hair mask. The result is terrible: probably this hair was dehydrated,
        and the mask was made for reconstruction.</p>
