            <p>The term may seem technical and complicated, but the capillary schedule is nothing more than an agenda of treatments
                to recover the healthy characteristics of the hair. The schedule is divided into 3 steps that must be done separately: 
                hydration, nutrition, and reconstruction. Hydration will do water replacement (how do you know if your hair needs 
                hydration?),nutrition will do lipid replacement (Does your hair need nutrition?). Reconstruction will do protein 
                replacement (how do you know that hair needs reconstruction? ).</p>

            <p>Experts recommend that people organize the program in a table that specifies the days of the reconstruction, hydration,
                and nutrition procedures for the strands. Only a complete schedule in this way can make hair back to be completely healthy.
                This is because each of the steps promotes specific care and gives the hair all the care they need. The procedures within
                the schedule can be made from pre-existing schedules or customized according to the hair need.</p>
