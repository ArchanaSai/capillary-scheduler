            <p>The hair is constantly exposed to various aggressions that make it weak, brittle, and dry. What also
                 damages the hair are chemical processes, pollution, wind, and sunlight. Hair reconstruction is a 
                 very effective treatment for these problems. It gives life back to the hair and prevents further 
                 damage to the hair. It is the “”heaviest”” step in the schedule, and it is responsible for rebuilding
                  the hair fiber, restoring the protein of the hair, especially keratin.</p>

            <p>Keratin is a protein produced by the human body, representing about 90% of the hair’s hair’s constitution.
                It is responsible for ensuring strength, elasticity, and resistance to the hair fiber, as it is extremely
                rich in amino acids and a powerful reconstructor of the damaged fiber.</p>

            <p>Since it is the most powerful step in the capillary schedule, reconstruction must be done based on the real
                need for the hair. Only extremely damaged and elastic strands need to recover all the lost capillary mass
                and undergo hair reconstruction weekly. Otherwise, every 15 days is the most suitable period.</p>

            <p>The process deposits keratin, proteins, amino acids, and minerals in the hair. All of these are essential 
                moisturizers for the structure of the hair. These components treat the outer layers of the hair shaft. 
                They are responsible for the shine, softness, and natural balance of the hair.</p>

            <p>The results n can be seen in the first session. The hair already shows signs of recovery in texture and 
                becomes stronger and more resistant.</p>
