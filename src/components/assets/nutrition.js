            <p>The nutrition stage consists of replacing the lipids in the hair, especially in dry and porous hair. 
                They have an inherent lack of sebum (fat) in the hair. But what are lipids? Basically, they are fats
                produced by the scalpâ€™s sebaceous glands, and their function is to give a protective layer to the strands, 
                leaving them soft, flexible, shiny, and with the cuticles aligned. </p>

            <p>The nutrition stage consists of using products that contain oils, butter, and other moisturizing components.
                We can say that this stage is an oil bath in your hair. </p>

            <p>The composition of products with nutrient action promotes hair reconstruction and avoid unwanted split ends.</p>

            <p>These components will allow the lipids to act on the strands and obtain the desired results for this step.</p>

            <p>It is through capillary nutrition that vital energy of the hair will be reinforced, which, in a certain way, 
                has been eroded by the most varied external agents such as sun, wind, seawater, swimming pool, chemicals, and others. </p>
