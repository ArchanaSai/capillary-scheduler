            <p>Have you heard of a capillary schedule? It is a hair treatment that consists of hydrating,
            nourishing, and reconstruction.</p>

            <p>If you have never heard of a hair schedule, it is because you have certainly not had to do
            any intensive hair repairs in the past few months. This treatment agenda is necessary for 
            women who want to replenish the nutrients in the hair, recovering the hair health lost in 
            chemical processes and daily life.</p>
            
            <p>The capillary schedule gives an incredible result and restores the strands because it 
            consists of the three treatments that the hair needs most. According to the need, this
            care routine includes hydration, nutrition, and reconstruction of the damaged hair fiber. 
            Before joining, you need to know what your hair needs the most to focus on one stage or another.</p>

            <p>Nothing better than leaving the salon with that incredible hair, hydrated, soft, and with
            a super movement, right? But, we know that this treatment with a professional is not done 
            as frequently as we wish. So what really matters is investing in the capillary schedule! 
            The truth is that often, we end up taking care of our hair more often at home, due to costs
            and practicality. However, many people believe that home hair care is all about hydration.</p>

            <p>It is not that hydration is not essential, because it is. But it is not enough to supply all 
            hair needs. It would be like giving only water to a hungry person. Thatâ€™s where the hair schedule
            comes in. It is essential for maintaining complete hair health.</p>

            <p>We are going to tell you how to maintain a homemade care routine by setting up 
            a simple and very, very, very effective hair schedule!</p>
